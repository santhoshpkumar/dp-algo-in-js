 * Problem:
 * Given a string, find a longest palindromic subsequence in it.
 *
 * What is Longest Palindromic Sub­se­quence:
 * A longest palindromic subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same rel­a­tive order,
 * but not necessarily contiguous(not sub­string) and palindrome in nature
 * ( means the subsequence will read same from the front and back ).
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * String A = " AABCDEBAZ";
 *
 * Longest Palindromic subsequence: ABCBA or ABDBA or ABEBA
 *
 * There are many subsequences can be found which are palindrome
 * like, AA, BCB, ABA, BB etc but we need to find the one with the maximum length.
