## Algorithm: Dynamic Programming using JavaScript

This project is a collection of problem's that can be solved using dynamic programming approach implemented in
JavaScript.

The inspiration for this projects is to document and learn Dynamic Programming (DP) in the process mastering and
applying the technique of thinking in terms of solving problems which fall into category of dynamic programming.

For a problem to be able to be solved using DP it needs to satisfy two conditions:

1. Optimal Substructure

2. Overlapping sub problem

To solve the problem, identify the recursive equation, validate it and proceed to implement in your trusted
favorite programming language.
